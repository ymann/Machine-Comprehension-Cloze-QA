# Cloze-Style Reading Comprehension with Deep Learning
A new approach to solving the reading comprehension problem using deep learning techniques.

Team members: Yonah Mann, Rohan Menezes, Brandon Lin

We have three different files for our three different models. They are called Non_Deep_Baseline.ipynb (our non-deep baseline model: logistic regression), base_model_700.ipynb (our deep baseline model: a vanilla Bi-LSTM), and advanced_model.ipynb (our deep advanced model: a Bi-GRU with attention). Each file contains the corresponding model and all the code necessary to run it. 

To run each of our models, simply open the corresponding .ipynb file in either Google Colab, Jupyter, or some other alternative. Then, upload embedding_matrix, vocab.txt, and entities.txt (all located in the GitHub repository) and then simply run all cells in the file to download the necessary data and run our model!
